    <p>“OpenCoesione” is Italy’s first national web portal on the implementation of investments programmed in the 2007-2013 programming cycle by Regions and State Central Administrations via cohesion policy resources. Publication of data from now on allows Italian citizens to evaluate if and how both implementation projects meet their needs and whether financial resources are allocated effectively.</p>

    <p>The web portal contains information about any single project carried out to implement
      cohesion policy, and more specifically: funds used, places and categories, subjects involved and implementation
      timeframes. Users can either download raw data or surf through interactive diagrams itemised by expenditure
      categories, places and type of intervention, as well as have access to files on single
      projects and subjects involved. Data on the local economy and social context are provided as well.
    </p>

    <p>Sources of data published are: with regards to EU structural funds, central monitoring systems provided by the beneficiaries of funds; and, with regard to the Italy’s national Development and Cohesion Fund, also the resolutions of the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE), which assigns resources to single interventions.</p>

    <h4>Principle</h4>

    <p>The lack of transparency on how public money is spent is one of the main reasons for the slow pace in implementing development policies and in understanding whether investment projects actually respond to local demand. This is a particularly hot topic in Italy at present given the low absorption rate of EU Structural Funds and the debate all over Europe continues on the extent to which, after decades of subsidies, whether the European Regional Policy is effective or not.</p>

    <p>The OpenCoesione web portal provides analysis and monitoring on the use of cohesion policy resources, offering information, accessible to anyone, on what is funded, who is involved and where.</p>

    <p>Although EU Structural Fund regulations already have provisions on data publication, in Italy most of the information is dispersed across a wide number of managing authorities, is published in PDF format, and contains only a very limited number of variables. OpenCoesione collects the information in a single place, “opens” the data and offers a much wider number of variables on single projects.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, OpenCoesione represents an attempt to: firstly, improve policy effectiveness through better knowledge on which kind of investment projects are actually carried out in the territory; secondly, enhance coordination among the administrations responsible for implementing the projects; and, thirdly, provide more public scrutiny on who benefits from the resources (also with the aim to avoid corruption and fraud). The final aim of the project is to encourage greater public participation and collaboration.</p>

    <h4>About data</h4>

    <p>Data about projects funded via cohesion policies can be downloaded here. Local and economic data including funding from National Funds for Development and Cohesion can be downloaded
      <a href="http://www.cipecomitato.it/it/opendata.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Besides data, OpenCoesione publishes metadata, links to detailed information and the user license  (according to CC BY-SA 3.0 standard). The “Creative Commons licence 3.0 – Italy” allows re-using data provided that the origin is acknowledged and the sharing is stated. Therefore users are allowed to: replicate, share and circulate both data and analyses in the public domain; change and adapt data; use data for business purposes, providing that the same licence applies.</p>

    <p>Data is made available in CSV (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">coma separated values</a>) format. Some data may be compressed to make download easier. Setting for CSV data is: charter type Unicode (UTF-8), language “Italian” (Italy).</p>

    <h4>About information</h4>

    <p>Projects (“Progetti”) – Projects in OpenCoesione refer to initiatives funded within cohesion policies and defined with a single act (e.g. a contract, a call etc.). Each project has been assigned an Unique Project ID code (i.e. Codice Unico di Progetto,CUP).</p>

    <p>Subjects (“Soggetti”) – It’s either a public or private subject (a public authority, a non-profit institution, an individual or an business) which has a role related to one or more projects. Roles managed are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Programming Authority (Programmatore)</strong>, the decision-maker(s) on the project financing. Usually it is a central or local government authority.</li>
      <li><strong>Recipients (“Attuatore”)</strong>, i.e. those who are in charge for the execute the project. For European structural funds these relate to the “beneficiary” according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, who is also the recipient of the financial contribution. The recipient may cooperate with other subjects to execution of the project but in such case the monitoring system may not always track them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Time – Start and end dates, both planned and actual ones. Information about times may sometime not be available even if the project has been completed.</p>

    <p>Categories (“Temi sintetici”) – they are based on a grouping of the EU Priority themes (according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006): Research and Innovation, Competitiveness, Digital Agenda, Energy and energy efficiency, Environment and risk prevention, Occupation and workers mobility, Urban and Rural Regeneration, Natural, Cultural and Tourist Attraction, Transport and Infrastructure Networks, Child and Elderly People Care, Social inclusion, Education and Training, Public Administration Capacity Building.</p>

    <p>Maps – Each project is located at the national, regional, county, or municipality level. Regional maps show all the projects located either at a regional or lower level. County maps show all the projects located at a county or lower level. Projects located at a national level are not indicated on any map. Projects located in multiple places are shown in all the different levels where they are present. Maps also show the number of projects located at each level and the corresponding amount of resources established (total public sector funding and actual expenses).</p>
